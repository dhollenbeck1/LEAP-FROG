This script will test the VehicleClass script with mission planner
used for the maiden flight of LEAPFROG.

The dronekit maiden flight test is a single phase survey however, 
the single phase is broken up into sections.
The drone will take off and then begin a waypoint navigation
Once completing a portion of the waypoint navigation, the drone will then
be placed into loiter mode for some time. After the time is
